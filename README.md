This repository contains a demonstration of a common bug in ERC20 token contracts: an inaccurate `balanceOf` function.  The `balanceOfBug.sol` file shows the erroneous implementation, while `balanceOfFix.sol` provides the corrected version.  The bug results in incorrect balance reporting for users, potentially leading to trust issues and financial losses. The fix involves ensuring proper updating of the `balances` mapping in all relevant contract functions.
